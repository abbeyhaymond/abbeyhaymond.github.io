      <description>library(tidyverse) library(ggrepel) library(waffle) In May of 2020, Arizona Cardinals receiver, DeAndre Hopkins, joined the Jalen &amp;amp; Jacoby Show. He claimed that he is the best wide receiver in the NFL and compared himself to Julio Jones. Is he really better than “Jet” Jones?
I will take a look at some numbers throughout their careers.

      <description>The Patriots have been a powerhouse in the NFL for the past two decades. They have won six Super Bowl titles, and they looked like a team that was ready to claim another one during their 2017 season. Tom Brady had the most passing yards in a Super Bowl in 2018, so why was that not enough to lead his team to a victory?
I took a look at their numbers on offense during the Super Bowl.</description>
